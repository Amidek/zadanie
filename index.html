    <h1> Poison</h1>
    <h3><i>by Alice Cooper</i></h3>
    <p>
      Your cruel device<br>
      Your blood, like ice<br>
      One look, could kill<br>
      My pain, your thrill<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanna love you but I better not touch (don't touch)<br>
      I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop<br>
      I wanna kiss you but I want it too much (too much)<br>
      I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison<br>
      You're poison, running through my veins<br>
      You're poison<br>
      I don't wanna break these chains<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Your mouth, so hot<br>
      Your web, I'm caught<br>
      Your skin, so wet<br>
      Black lace, on sweat<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I hear you calling and it's needles and pins (and pins)<br>
      I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name<br>
      Don't wanna touch you but you're under my skin (deep in)<br>
      I wanna kiss you but your lips are venomous poison<br>
      You're poison, running through my veins<br>
      You're poison<br>
      I don't wanna break these chains<br>
      Poison... <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      One look, could kill<br>
      My pain, your thrill<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanna love you but I better not touch (don't touch)<br>
      I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop<br>
      I wanna kiss you but I want it too much (too much)<br>
      I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison<br>
      You're poison, running through my veins<br>
      You're poison<br>
      I don't wanna break these chains<br>
      Poison (Poi-son)<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanna love you but I better not touch (don't touch)<br>
      I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop<br>
      I wanna kiss you but I want it too much (too much)<br>
      I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison<br>
      Yeah<br>
      Well I don't wanna break these chains<br>
      Poison (Poi-son)<br>
      Runnin' deep inside my veins<br>
      Burnin' deep inside my brain<br>
      Poison (Poi-son)<br>
      And I don't wanna break these chains<br>
      Poison
